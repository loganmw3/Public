<h1> Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
<p>I would like to highlight some of my personal and class projects. Additionally I would like to highlight this page as well as some upcoming projects that I have in mind.</p>

<h2> Projects that are already completed </h2>
<ul> <li> Illinix </li>
    <li> Pacman </li>
    <li> Guitar Practicing app </li>
</ul>

<p> Illinix and Pacman were both projects that I completed at school with some of my peers. We worked very hard on them and spent countless hours attempting to perfect them. 
    <br>
    Along the way I learned many valuable collaborative skills and I would like to highlight these projects.
</p>


<h2> Projects I have locked and loaded that I just need to find a good place to start on them</h2>
<ol> 
    <li> LiveWell - Health monitoring app</li>
    <li> I would like to extend my guitar practing app to incorperate live feed back as well as incorpoerating a song decomposer so that we can distinguish different coords and strumming patterns</li>
</ol>
